      A misunderstanding that people may have about my cause:

    <div class="paragraph">
      People may be confused about the definition of "the Internet" here.
      Does that mean the application of the Internet? Or the way of working?
      Or something else?

      Argument:
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      My cause is to learn about the Internet, which does not mean that I need to
      learn all aspects of the Interent. I think it is necessary and important to
      know about the Internet, because more and more people are using the Internet
      nowadays.
      But what I can learn depends on the content that
      the course will cover. For example, in CSC 265, we have learned how the
      Internet works as well as how to design the webpages using HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript. They are all related to the Interent and help me better
      understand what I can do with the Internet.
